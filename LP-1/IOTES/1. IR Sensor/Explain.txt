### 1. Objective
The objective of this application is to connect an **IR sensor** to a **Raspberry Pi** or **Arduino** board and write a program that detects obstacles. When an obstacle is detected, the program will trigger an **LED** to notify the user. This simple application is intended to illustrate how sensors and actuators can interact in a basic embedded system.

### 2. Expected Output
- The **IR sensor** will detect the presence of an obstacle.
- When an obstacle is detected (usually when something crosses the IR beam), the **LED** will turn on.
- If no obstacle is detected, the **LED** remains off.

### 3. Software Requirement
- **For Raspberry Pi:**
  - **Raspberry Pi OS** installed.
  - **Python** programming language.
  - **GPIO library** (`RPi.GPIO`) to interact with the GPIO pins.
  
- **For Arduino:**
  - **Arduino IDE**.
  - **Arduino Uno** or any compatible board.
  
- **Hardware**:
  - **IR Sensor** (typically an IR emitter and receiver pair).
  - **LED** (with a suitable current-limiting resistor).
  - **Breadboard and jumper wires**.
  - **Raspberry Pi** or **Arduino**.

### 4. Theory

#### A. Necessary Concepts

1. **IR Sensor**:
   - An **IR sensor** typically consists of an IR LED (emitter) and an IR receiver.
   - The emitter sends out infrared light, and the receiver detects any reflected light.
   - When an object obstructs the beam between the emitter and receiver, the sensor detects the change and outputs a signal indicating the presence of an obstacle.
   
2. **Raspberry Pi GPIO**:
   - The **Raspberry Pi** has **GPIO pins** that can be used to interact with external devices.
   - The GPIO pins can be set as input or output and can handle signals like HIGH (on) or LOW (off).
   
3. **LED as Output Device**:
   - An **LED** is connected to the GPIO pin to provide a visual notification.
   - The LED will be turned on (set to HIGH) when an obstacle is detected and turned off (set to LOW) when there is no obstacle.

4. **Wiring**:
   - The **IR sensor**'s output is connected to a GPIO input pin.
   - The **LED** is connected to another GPIO output pin.
   - The sensor’s **VCC** and **GND** are connected to the power supply and ground, respectively.

#### B. Algorithm and Explanation

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize the GPIO pins for both the **IR sensor** and the **LED**.
2. Continuously read the signal from the IR sensor.
   - If the sensor detects an obstacle (input is HIGH or LOW depending on sensor type), turn on the LED.
   - If no obstacle is detected, turn off the LED.
3. Repeat the process to continuously monitor for obstacles.

### 5. Code Implementation

#### For **Raspberry Pi** (Python)

1. **Wiring Setup:**
   - **IR sensor**: Connect the **VCC** to 3.3V, **GND** to ground, and **OUT** to a GPIO input pin (e.g., GPIO17).
   - **LED**: Connect the **Anode** (long leg) to GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO18), and the **Cathode** (short leg) to ground through a 220Ω resistor.

2. **Python Code for Raspberry Pi**:
```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# Setup GPIO mode
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Define GPIO pins
IR_SENSOR_PIN = 17  # GPIO pin connected to IR sensor
LED_PIN = 18        # GPIO pin connected to LED

# Setup the IR sensor pin as input
GPIO.setup(IR_SENSOR_PIN, GPIO.IN)

# Setup the LED pin as output
GPIO.setup(LED_PIN, GPIO.OUT)

# Main program loop
try:
    while True:
        # Read the input from the IR sensor
        if GPIO.input(IR_SENSOR_PIN) == GPIO.HIGH:  # Obstacle detected
            GPIO.output(LED_PIN, GPIO.HIGH)  # Turn on LED
            print("Obstacle detected! LED ON.")
        else:  # No obstacle
            GPIO.output(LED_PIN, GPIO.LOW)  # Turn off LED
            print("No obstacle detected. LED OFF.")
        
        # Wait a small amount of time before checking again
        time.sleep(0.1)

# Clean up on exit
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Program exited.")
    GPIO.cleanup()
```

#### For **Arduino**:

1. **Wiring Setup:**
   - **IR sensor**: Connect **VCC** to 5V, **GND** to ground, and **OUT** to a digital input pin (e.g., Pin 7).
   - **LED**: Connect the **Anode** to Pin 13, and **Cathode** to ground through a 220Ω resistor.

2. **Arduino Code**:
```cpp
#define IR_SENSOR_PIN 7  // Pin connected to the IR sensor
#define LED_PIN 13       // Pin connected to the LED

void setup() {
  pinMode(IR_SENSOR_PIN, INPUT);  // Set IR sensor pin as input
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);       // Set LED pin as output
  Serial.begin(9600);             // Start serial communication
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = digitalRead(IR_SENSOR_PIN);  // Read the IR sensor value

  if (sensorValue == HIGH) {  // Obstacle detected
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);  // Turn on LED
    Serial.println("Obstacle detected! LED ON.");
  } else {  // No obstacle
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);   // Turn off LED
    Serial.println("No obstacle detected. LED OFF.");
  }

  delay(100);  // Wait for 100ms
}
```

### 6. Conclusion
This application demonstrates a basic obstacle detection system using an **IR sensor** and an **LED** to notify the user. The **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino** boards are utilized for reading sensor input and controlling the LED output. The system works by continuously monitoring the IR sensor’s input, and when an obstacle is detected, it activates the LED. This application can be extended to more complex systems like autonomous robots or security systems.
